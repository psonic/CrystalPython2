# Input Files Required

This folder should contain the following files for the Crystal Video Generator to work:

## Required Files:
- `logo-estratto-ai.svg` - Main logo SVG file with unified paths
- `logo.pdf` - Alternative PDF version of the logo
- `texture.jpg/png/tif` - Texture file (automatically detected)
- `26.png` - Fallback texture file

## Video Files (ignored by git):
- `*.MOV` files - Background video files (kept locally only)

## Usage:
Place your logo SVG/PDF and texture files in this directory before running the generator.
Video files should be placed here as well but won't be tracked by git due to their size.
